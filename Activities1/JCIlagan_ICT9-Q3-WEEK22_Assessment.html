        No matter how intelligent a student is, he will reap the benefits of his education only if he has developed 
        <span style="color:purple"><strong>adequate listening skills</strong></span> in the classroom. Teachers typically give direct instruction 
        and then provide clarification as necessary. Students who listen keenly to directions and lectures -- rather than simply 
        hearing them -- have distinct advantages. Efficient listening in the classroom saves time and results in improved academic and social skills.
