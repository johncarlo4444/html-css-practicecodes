            HTML provides a number of components that may be used to define text with a special meaning and gives us the capability to format text without the need for CSS.
            Formatting text is important because it highlights the important text and gives an attractive body to the viewers.
            It can also help readers with difficulty in viewing the text, a process called web accessibility.
